\title{Load uniform shock}
\usage{
ems_uniform_shock(var, value, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{Character of length 1, the variable to be shocked.}

\item{value}{Numeric length 1, value of uniform shock.}

\item{...}{One or more variable-specific key-value pairs
separated by commas corresponding to the parts of a variable
that will receive a uniform shock.}
}
\description{
\code{ems_uniform_shock()} loads uniform shocks for
processing as well as conducts a series of compatibility
checks. A uniform shock is one which applies a homogeneous
value across all or part of a variable (using \code{...}).  The
accepted values for \code{...} depend on the \code{"var"} specified
and set mappings associated with this variable. If a uniform
shock is to be carried out, the output of this function is a
required input to the \code{"shock"} argument within the
\code{\link[=ems_deploy]{ems_deploy()}} function.
}
\examples{
# fully uniform: all variable elements receive the same shock value
afeall_full <- ems_uniform_shock(var = "afeall",
                                 value = 2)

# partially uniform: applied only to the "chn" element in set REGr (REG)
# Note that set designations must consist of the concatenation of the
# standard set (e.g., REG) and variable-specific index (e.g., r).
afeall_chn <- ems_uniform_shock(var = "afeall",
                                REGr = "chn",
                                value = 2)
}
