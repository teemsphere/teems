\usage{
ems_model(model_input, closure_file, var_omit = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_input}{Input containing the model. Character
vector of length 1, file name in working directory or path
to a .tab file. See
\href{https://github.com/teems-org/teems-models}{teems-models}
for vetted model inputs and compatible Tablo file
formatting.}

\item{closure_file}{A character of length 1 (default is
\code{NULL}). File name in working directory or path to a ".cls"
closure file. See
\href{https://github.com/teems-org/teems-models}{teems-models}
for formatting of closure files.}

\item{var_omit}{A character vector (default is \code{NULL}).
Variables that to be substituted with \code{0} within the Tablo
model file and removed from the designated closure (if
present).}

\item{...}{A named pairlist assigning aggregation-specific
values to model coefficients. The LHS must correspond to a
model coefficient declared within \code{"model_input"}. The RHS
is the value to be assigned and may be either a numeric
length 1, a data frame or data frame extension (e..g,
tibble, data table), or path to a CSV file.

If a numeric length 1 is provided to a non-binary
coefficient or coefficient with a set affiliation, all set
combinations will be assigned this uniform value. Data frame
equivalent and CSV inputs must contain all set
aggregation-specific elements to be replaced (with sets as
columns) as well as a "Value" column with new values. This
replacement will be subject to structure checks according to
set aggregations specified in \code{\link[=ems_data]{ems_data()}}.

Note that set names in any loaded data must be provided as
the model-specific concatenation of the standard set name
plus the variable-specific index. For example, the standard
set name "REG" with subindex "r" would be "REGr".}
}
\value{
A tibble with attributes containing the parsed model
input for use within the \code{"model"} argument of
\code{\link[=ems_deploy]{ems_deploy()}}.
}
\description{
\code{ems_model} loads the model and its closure,
conducts pre-deployment checks, determines temporal
dynamics, and allows for the loading of aggregated data. The
output of this function is a required input to the \code{"model"}
argument of the \code{\link[=ems_deploy]{ems_deploy()}} function.
