\title{Compose model results}
\usage{
ems_compose(
  cmf_path,
  type = c("all", "variable", "coefficient"),
  name = NULL,
  minimal = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cmf_path}{Character length 1 (default is \code{NULL}), path to
the cmf file generated by \code{\link[=ems_deploy]{ems_deploy()}}.}

\item{type}{Character length 1, type of data to parse
(default includes all). Choices:
\itemize{
\item \code{"all"}: All model variables and coefficients
\item \code{"variable"}: Percentage change values for model variables
\item \code{"coefficient"}: Values for model coefficients
}}

\item{name}{Character vector, a subset of the selected type
filtered by name.}

\item{minimal}{Logical length 1, default \code{FALSE}. Whether to
run a minimal number of checks and modifications to output
data. If \code{TRUE} chronological data will not be loaded and
the model file will not be parsed, meaning: 1) no post model
set checks are conducted between model sets as written out
from the model input and solver set binaries; and 2) time
steps will remain in their model format. If a model input
with no set writeout is used (e.g., \code{\link[=solve_in_situ]{solve_in_situ()}}),
this option must be set to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the parsed model results according
to the specified type.
}
\description{
\code{ems_compose()} retrieves and processes results
from a solved model run. Results are parsed according to the
specified type (variables, coefficients, or base data). Data
validation and consistency checks are performed during the
parsing process.
